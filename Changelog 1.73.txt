Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.73

[Added] Players can now sell and buy items from a marketplace. The market can be accessed at the Banker.
[Added] You can store or take all coins at once now.
[Changed] Safes can be blown up and  will open everything again. The last changes were reverted.
[Changed] The group marker refresh time got increased for a better performance. Give me a hint if it is too slow.
[Changed] The group management menu shows no longer that players are in groups. Every indicator that a player is already in a group got removed.
[Changed] Chainsaws have a different quality now. If the quality is better more wood can be harvested from a tree.
