Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.64

[Changed] The cave in the middle of the map got some corrections.
[Changed] The coyote backpack, most food variations like MRE, cooked meat and many canned food and drinks are no longer for sale. This was changed due to new upcoming server missions.
[Changed] Ladders can no longer be rotated.
[Fixed] Tank traps could not be crafted - thx @Seb.
[Fixed] Animated Heli Crashes should no longer crash into the cave in the middle of the map.
[Removed] Cessna spawn at Sector A due to the bouncing cessna models.
