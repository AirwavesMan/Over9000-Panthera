Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.61

Note: We have done lots of code optimizations in this update. Please give us a hint if you noticed something weird.

[Added] Sector A in Vatra
		- The Sector and the Central Bank are Server Events now. The Sector has a 66% chance to spawn and the Central Bank a 33% chance each restart. Only one of the events can spawn. Unfortunately the server cannot hold both events.
		- The Sector has many hard MGs and AI groups - move after you have killed an enemy.
		- The Sector is not designed to get finished by a one man army, work together as a team.
		- In the Sector you can find crates with loot at random positions.
		- The combat timer in Sector A will never reset, you are always in combat as long as you fight there.
		- Anti logout system for the whole Sector area.
		- No zombies and no loot spawn in Sector A.
		- Sector AIs are not lootable and will be cleared after death.
