Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.63

[Added] On removing or packing own builing parts a red bubble will be displayed so you can see which builing part will be removed. This should prevent removing the wrong metal floor or the vault. Note: Not all building items have this red bubble but most of them.
[Added] On removing or packing gear buildings with coins a sound will be played and the remaining coins from the gear building will be added to your inventory. This will prevent the coins loss at all if buildings will be removed.
[Changed] Crashing is no longer allowed. That means no crash in any kind is allowed now. It does not depend on how you have crashed. Even by accident you will be punished.
[Changed] The PVE Mode has new rules.
[Changed] Player UI will no longer be displayed in the spawn menu.
[Fixed] Land vehicles could be spawned from the virtual garage without a heli pad at the base. This will fix the random spawn on the map for land vehicles from the virtual garage if no heli pad is next to the garage.
