Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.60

Note: The AI-Mission System got a code overhaul. Please report everything that is not working from your point of view.

[Added] M4A1 CCO Camo and M4A1 Holo Tarn can be used with the Attachment System now.
[Added] AI-Mission have a german localization now.
[Changed] AI-Mission descriptions and texts were reworked. - Many AI-Missions have a different name now. This comes from the german localization to keep the translations consistent. We have not changed something at the mission itself besides correcting bugs.
[Changed] AI-Missions getting cleared by shooting the AIs now no longer with running to the mission center. - This was mainly changed due to some performance tweaks and to fix micro lags.
[Changed] Big and small AI-Missions have their own display message position on the screen now. - This prevent the spawn of two messages on the screen directly above or in a short time in a row, so the first message cannot be read.
[Changed] MGs, guarding vehicles and remaining AIs at AI-Missions getting cleared directly after the AI-Mission was finished.
[Changed] The Halo Spawn will be removed with this update. Only ground spawns are possbile now. - We changed that due to the halo speed exploits which are not really fixable. Another reason is that dead players will be always back after a very short time and a won fight can turned into a loss again. This is not how it should work and it can be massively frustrating, especially for new players.
[Changed] Increasing the buy price of safes from 100.000 Coins to 150.000 Coins.
[Changed] Increasing the buy price of lockboxes from 20.000 Coins to 50.000 Coins.
[Fixed] Coin rewards at the buried treasure event was not functional - thx @*OSS*Rumpy.
