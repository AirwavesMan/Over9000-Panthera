[Changed] Players need an entrenching tool to remove their plot pole now - we changed that due to players trapped themselves inside a base after removing their plot pole
[Changed] Build a plot pole checks not longer the build item count in range - this was changed as well to prevent getting trapped inside of the own base if the plot level was not the same as the build item count
