[Added] The Intro Camera can be disabled via Settings Menu now
[Changed] Players need an entrenching tool to remove their plot pole now - we changed that due to players trapped themselves inside a base after removing their plot pole
[Changed] Build a plot pole checks not longer the build item count in range - this was changed as well to prevent getting trapped inside of the own base if the plot level was not the same as the build item count
[Changed] The black screen from the uncouncious animation will be disabled if the player switches to its weapon but not before switching
[Fixed] Uncouncious had a chance not to enable user input again if the player has no weapon - Fix from Epoch Mod [73118c2]
[Fixed] Uncouncious had a chance not to enable user input again if the player pushes a button that interrupts enable user input
