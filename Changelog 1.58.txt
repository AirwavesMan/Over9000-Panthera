Over9000 Panthera Server Version: 1.58

[Added] The Intro Camera can be disabled via the Settings Menu now.
[Added] Ammo, food, drink, half tanktrap, half wire and half scrap metal crates can be sold now.
[Added] A player who has received coins from another player now gets a notification (sound/message).
[Added] Doctor Ivan has found his way to Panthera Island - more in the Info Menu.
[Added] The music sheets have a rightclick option and a chance to get XP now.
[Added] Special Event System - We noticed that many players were using the same methods to make money. Farming Oil, Sapphires or searching loot at the ship cemetery are the most common actions beside the missions. We thought to ourselves that a random event system would make the money gaining process less static and more variable. 
		This means:
			- The Event System will decide on server startup which scenarios to run, of the 4 following:
				- Filling Oil is disabled
				- Collecting Sapphires at the Coral Reef is disabled
				- Searching for sunken ships at the Ship Cemetery is disabled
				- Nothing is disabled
			- Every scenario has a 25% chance to occur
			- The white boards at the Trader Cities have an extra Scroll Option for "Recent Rumors" now, you can read all the information about the current event there.
			- The item newspaper has the "Recent Rumors" option as well, and can be used multiple times.
