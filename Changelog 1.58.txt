[Added] Every AI-Missions will spawn once before an AI-Mission can spawn twice now
[Added] Special Event System - We noticed, that players doing every time almost the same actions to make money. Farming Oil, Sapphires or searching loot at the ship cemetery are the most common actions beside the missions. We thought to ourselves that a random Event System would make this gain money process less static and more variable. 
		This means:
			- The Event System will decide directly on server startup which make money action is because of an incident not useable for one server period.
			- At the moment we have 4 scenarios:
				- Filling Oil is disabled
				- Collecting Sapphires is disabled
				- Searching for sunken ships at the Ship Cemetery is disabled
				- Nothing is disabled
			- Every scenario has a 25% to occur
			- The white boards at the Trader Cities have an extra Scroll Option for "Recent Rumors" now, you can read all the information about the current event there
			- The item newspaper has the "Recent Rumors" option as well and can be used multiple times
[Changed] Players need an entrenching tool to remove their plot pole now - we changed that due to players trapped themselves inside a base after removing their plot pole
